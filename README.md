# Social media impacted Susceptible-Infected Model
The SI model is one of the simplest compartmental models, and many models are derivations of this basic form. The model consists of two compartmentsâ€“ S for the number of susceptible, I for the number of infectious. However, traditional models assume that everybody has the same contact network and same chance of getting infected. Through social media analysis, strength of human relationship can be taken into consideration in disease spread. Lower variance shows that factoring contact network into disease spread can make the pattern more predictable.

--------------
For a small network in which everybody is close, traditional SI model treats everybody the same, but with the help of social media, people can be differentiated; people with closer relationship to infector tend to get infected more quickly. Intersection of S and I line indicates how quickly the disease can spread.<br/>
